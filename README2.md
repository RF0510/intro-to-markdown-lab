HangMan

## Project Description
My app is called Hang Man. It's a game app for a single player who wants to play Hang Man online. An player can join an online game and play a round of Hang Man. With the score being kept automatically and the game results displayed at the end of a round. Users will have the option to play again. In the future, I'd like to add a feature where one player can play against the computer.
